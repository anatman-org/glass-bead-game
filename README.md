# The Annotated Manual of the Glass Bead Game

> For although in a certain sense it may be easier and less demanding
  for frivolous people to speak of non-beings than of beings,
  for the devout and conscientious historian,
  it is a different matter entirely.
  Nothing is so resistant to being illustrated by words,
  yet nothing is so necessary to place before the eyes of humanity,
  as certain things whose existence can neither be demonstrated nor proven.
  On the contrary, by the very fact that pious and diligent men treat them
  as if they were beings, they are brought a little closer to existence and
  to the possibility of being born.
~ ALBERT.v2
