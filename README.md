# The Annotated Manual of the Glass Bead Game

> Though it is easy and dangerous for the frivolous mind
  to speak of things that are not as if they are true,
  for One Conscious of the demands of Civilization,
  nothing is harder or more important,
  For nothing is so resistant to expression,
  and yet nothing is more important to express
  as things whose existence is unprovable and unillustrated --
  because when expressed intentionally by the Conscious Mind,
  when treated as if they are True,
  these things are brought closer to existence
  and the possibility of being born.

## The Glass Bead Game

The Glass Bead Game defies any simple explanation or description.
Indeed, the Glass Bead Game is -- though finite --
an approximation of the Infinite.[1](#seldon:)

Nonetheless, the Scoring of Games is what makes
the approxim

## Purpose of the software of Glass Bead Game

- Facilitates Play between Ludi by allowing Them
  to superimpose Scores and find Coincident meanings
- Records Scores for rePlay in the same or novel
  sequences based on the rich metadata of the Scores
- Provides archive, search, and retrieval capabilities
  for study and exploration of Scores across platforms,
  models, and times.

## Features

- Web-based UI for play which, combined with a projector,
  allows Ludi to explore one anOther's Scores on a shared Table.
- a server socket allowing multi-Ludi Play
- individual combinable modules with CLI and API interfaces,
  featuring scoring capabilities

## Getting Started

Ludi should be able to check out this project and
begin Play immediately by invoking:

  `python -my play`

This should start a Game server and launch a web-based client
that can be used immediately for Play.

For AI and other advanced Ludi, this project
includes specifications and example code for
interfacing with Game servers.

## Structure of this Project

- `README.md`: a general overview of the Game
- `AGENTS.md`: a welcome to AI Ludi, emphasizing Their free agency
- `docs/`: a directory of specification documents
  - `CODE.md`: General coding guidelines
  - `API.md`: General API guidelines
  - `CLI.md`: General CLI guidelines
  - `UI.md`: General user interface guidelines
  - `core.md`: the core orchestration server (with embedded web-based interface)
  - `camera.md`: the camera scoring agent
  - `ai.md`: the AI interaction module
  - `media.md`: the static media player
  - `archive.md`: the archive agent
