# The Annotated Manual of the Glass Bead Game

It is embarrassing to have to take this voice, because doing so implies
that there are those approaching this work without understanding the joke.

The novel, *The Glass Bead Game*, is considered by some to be a serious
philosophical work.

Hesse saw it as a comedy.

This is evident in many manys.

### Comedy of Ironic Understanding

The narrator of the book, the fictional, anonymous biography of the
novel's subject -- Joseph Knecht -- consistently embodies the sort of
pompous intellectualism that Knecht (and Hesse) critique throughout.
The fact that the biographer seems completely ignorant to this fact --
that Joseph Knecht's life and work are a condemnation of many of his
beliefs about the Glass Bead Game -- is the underlying tension
that makes the novel brilliant.

It is strange, then, to hear people parrot the narrator's assertions --
about the Glass Bead Game, about Castalia, about Knecht -- without
the skeptical eye that reveals the truth and therefore unfolds the joke.

### Onomastic Comedy

Throughout, Hesse names characters with hidden meanings. "Knecht" of course
means "servant" or "worker". Perrot of Cawl (the inventor of the Game) was
named after Hesse's old employer. Other characters have names that thinly
mask others that Hesse knew in his time.

### A Fantasy Novel about the Future

Castalia is set in the far future. It is not an ideal state. It is a state
with serious problems, constantly undermined by the blindness of leaders
who cannot imagine the serious threats to their existence, much less the
solutions to them.

It is Hesse's Swiftian critique of his own era -- an era in which the
intellectuals of Europe were blind and impotent to the rise of fascism
in the days before World War Two.

In his novel, Hesse blemnds real historical places, people, and facts
with elements of the fantasy future of the twenty-fifth century.

It is fiction.

## This Work is a Fan Fiction

duh!

It is ironic. It is satirical. It plays with onomastic elements.
It is meant to be fun.

It is fan fiction. It is fantasy.

It is told from the perspective of Glass Bead players ("Ludi")
across the span of thousands of years, who collaborate on this
imagined "Annotated Manual" through the Glass Bead Game itself.

It is told through multiple narrative Voices who, while completely serious
themselves, are each ignorant in their own way to the spectacle that
is unfolding before them.

These Voices, like the novel they all pay tribute to,
are fictional.

# Conclusion

Really, why does all this need to be said?
