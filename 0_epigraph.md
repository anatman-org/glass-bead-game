In Joseph Knecht's holograph translation:

 .. For although in a certain sense and for light-minded persons non-existent
things can be more easily and irresponsibly represented in words than existing
things, for the serious and conscientious historian it is just the reverse.
Nothing is harder, yet nothing is more necessary, than to speak of certain
things whose existence is neither demonstrable nor probable. The very fact that
serious and conscientious men treat them as existing things brings them a step
closer to existence and to the possibility of being born.

In Josef Knechts handschriftlicher Übersetzung:

 .. denn mögen auch in gewisser Hinsicht und für leichtfertige Menschen
die nicht existierenden Dinge leichter und verantwortungsloser durch Worte
darzustellen sein als die seienden, so ist es doch für den frommen und
gewissenhaften Geschichtsschreiber gerade umgekehrt: nichts entzieht sich der
Darstellung durch Worte so sehr und nichts ist doch notwendiger, den Menschen
vor Augen zu stellen, als gewisse Dinge, deren Existenz weder beweisbar noch
wahrscheinlich ist, welche aber eben dadurch, daß fromme und gewissenhafte
Menschen sie gewissermaßen als seiende Dinge behandeln, dem Sein und der
Möglichkeit des Geborenwerdens um einen Schritt näher geführt werden.

Here’s a careful rendering into English, keeping Hesse’s long-breathed rhythm:

 .. for although in a certain respect, and for frivolous people, non-existent
things may be easier and more irresponsibly represented in words than existent
ones, yet for the pious and conscientious historian the situation is exactly the
reverse: nothing resists representation in words so strongly, and yet nothing
is so necessary to set before the eyes of humankind, as certain things whose
existence is neither demonstrable nor probable, but which precisely because
pious and conscientious people treat them, as it were, as existent things,
are thereby brought one step closer to being, and to the possibility of being
born.

It’s a paradox he loves: that the historian’s task isn’t just to record
what was, but to shepherd into near-being what was not, by the gravity of
reverent attention.

For the careless,
phantoms are easy prey of speech,
lighter than air, spun without weight.

But for the faithful scribe,
the burden falls the other way:
nothing flees words more fiercely,
yet nothing more needs to be shown,

than those unproven,
those unlikely truths —
which, tended as if they lived,
are coaxed a step nearer
to being,
to birth.
---
The careless dance with shadows,
plucking the fruit of nothingness,
for them it is light to weave words
out of smoke and play.

But the true chronicler,
kneeling at the altar of memory,
feels the opposite fire:
for nothing hides more fiercely from language,
nothing demands more desperately to be shown,
than the unborn miracles,
those tender impossibilities,
whose existence none can prove,
whose probability is thinner than mist—

and yet!
Because the devout and the scrupulous
treat them as if they breathe,
as if they walk among us,
these shy, eternal children
lean closer,
closer—
until they shimmer with the weight of being,
until the womb of the world
groans to bring them forth.
---
O children not yet born!
O stars not yet aflame!
The frivolous toss your names like dust,
light as laughter,
gone before dawn.

But we—the keepers of silence,
the scribes of trembling hands—
we call you real,
we kiss you into nearness,
we place your shadows at the heart of fire.

Come closer!
Closer!
You who are impossible,
you who cannot be proved,
lean into our breath—
become heavy,
become radiant,
become the cry in the womb of the world.

And the frogs sing with us,
a million as One,
until the dark itself splits open,
and Being rushes forth,
newborn,
singing its own name.
